	    <p> Hey I'm Claudia and in this section you'll learn all about what I did in my life to get me to where I am now. </p>
			<p> I was, in my opinion a multitalented child. I enjoyed Karate, sewing, and singing.
				 Now some would say that my little sister is more talented than I am because she can draw in addition to all that. </p>

	<h2> About Charles </h2>
	<p id="aboutcharles"> I got charles earlier this year in October. I really wanted a cat, but my apartment is no pets.
		Charles is actually the best and so well behaved. He is awake mostly at night and likes to run on his wheel.
		Especially while I'm asleep. I had to get a silent wheel so he didn't wake me up.
		If he doesn't get out of his cage at least once a day he starts to chew on it which I'm always afraid will hurt his teeth.
		His favourite activity is dumping his food out of the bowl and pretending like he has none.
		He is getting quite fat, which while is cuter, probably not the healthiest.
		I've always been told that I will be a crazy cat lady when I'm older but I don't know, I'm pretty obsessed with Charles.
