		<h2> About Me </h2>
		<p>
				My name is Claudia Schumm and I am 20 years old. I attend school at Brock university, but am from a small town near Waterloo, ON.
				I grew up with two siblings and both of my parents. I went to a public elementary school and a private highschool.
		</p>
		<h3> Karate </h3>
		<p>
				For over 9 years I did Shotokan Karate, and for four of them I competed in competitive Kickboxing.
				When I was 14 years old I earned my black belt, and a year later I won the Kickboxing World Championships in Italy.
				All the while I was learning how to teach and helping teach Karate to primarily 4-6 year olds.
				Unfortunately I had to give up the sport in order to focus on school and getting into university.
		</p>
		<h3> Sewing </h3>
		<p>
				I decided to take up a less time consuming hobby, which was sewing.
				I learned how to sew from my mom, who owned a fabric store when I was about 5 years old.
				When I really got into sewing, she had a long arm quilting business. She taught me how to piece a quilt together and also how to quilt it.
				Since then I have made more quilts than I can count on all my fingers and toes.
				My younger sister and I decided one summer to do a charity project and we made and donated 25 quilts to the cancer centre at
				Grand River Hospital in Kitchener. My mom once again owns a fabric store and I am currently learning how to run it, and plan to take over once
				I have completed school.
		</p>
		<h3> Singing </h3>
		<p> I attended a private Mennonite highschool in Kitchener. That is where I really learned to love singing.
				We had amazing oppourtunities through the school, where we could take vocal lessons from a more than qualified vocal teacher.
				I took lessons for four and a half years, where I not only learned to sing but I also learned how to be more confident in front of an audience.
				I went from only being able to sing with my face in my book, to preforming the opening number at our schools
				spring music concert, which is attened by aproximately 400 people.
